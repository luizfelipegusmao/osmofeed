          "description": "Abstract\nMany hibernating bats in thermally stable, subterranean roosts have experienced precipitous declines from white-nose syndrome (WNS). However, some WNS-affected species also use thermally unstable roosts during winter that may impact their torpor patterns and WNS susceptibility. From November to March 2017–19, we used temperature-sensitive transmitters to document winter torpor patterns of tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) using thermally unstable roosts in the upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina. Daily mean roost temperature was 12.9 ± 4.9°C SD in bridges and 11.0 ± 4.6°C in accessible cavities with daily fluctuations of 4.8 ± 2°C in bridges and 4.0 ± 1.9°C in accessible cavities and maximum fluctuations of 13.8 and 10.5°C, respectively. Mean torpor bout duration was 2.7 ± 2.8 days and was negatively related to ambient temperature and positively related to precipitation. Bats maintained non-random arousal patterns focused near dusk and were active on 33.6% of tracked days. Fifty-one percent of arousals contained passive rewarming. Normothermic bout duration, general activity and activity away from the roost were positively related to ambient temperature, and activity away from the roost was negatively related to barometric pressure. Our results suggest ambient weather conditions influence winter torpor patterns of tricolored bats using thermally unstable roosts. Short torpor bout durations and potential nighttime foraging during winter by tricolored bats in thermally unstable roosts contrasts with behaviors of tricolored bats in thermally stable roosts. Therefore, tricolored bat using thermally unstable roosts may be less susceptible to WNS. More broadly, these results highlight the importance of understanding the effect of roost thermal stability on winter torpor patterns and the physiological flexibility of broadly distributed hibernating species.",

Simultaneously, unprecedented warm temperatures are being recorded worldwide, increasing both the average and maximum temperatures experienced in nature. Understanding how ectotherms, such as fishes, will react to the combined stress of parasites and higher average temperatures can help predict the impact of extreme events such as heat waves on populations. The critical thermal method (CTM), which assesses upper (CTmax) and lower (CTmin) thermal tolerance, is often used in acclimated ectotherms to help predict their tolerance to various temperature scenarios.

          "description": "Abstract\nUS quail species are vulnerable to population declines as a result of climate change, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, all of which can result in physiological stress. Additionally, population restoration techniques (PRTs), like translocations, also induce stress. Traditional assessments of avian stress hormone levels include capturing and handling birds to extract blood, methods that are inherently stressful and can compound stress analyses. However, the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) is metabolized from the blood and excreted in faeces as faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs). FCMs have been used as a non-invasive measurement of stress hormone levels in a variety of species, but must be validated for each species. The objective of this study was to biologically validate the use of FCMs as a non-invasive measurement of CORT levels in California valley quail (Callipepla californica). Reference and treatment quail were acclimated for 3 weeks in an outdoor aviary. Subsequently, treatment quail were subjected to a simulated 48-h translocation, a common and stress hormone-inducing PRT. Faecal samples were collected every 4 h and processed using an enzyme immunoassay. Mean FCM concentrations of treatment quail (41.50 ± 16.13 ng/g) were higher than reference FCM concentrations (24.07 ± 10.4 ng/g). These results biologically validate the use of FCMs as a non-invasive method to assess CORT levels in California valley quail, demonstrate diurnal variation in quail CORT levels, and confirm that quail translocations are a stress-inducing PRT. Ultimately, this research validates a new non-invasive tool for stress response measurement to advance quail research, management and conservation.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe amount of time that juvenile salmon remain in an estuary varies among and within populations, with some individuals passing through their estuary in hours while others remain in the estuary for several months. Underlying differences in individual physiological condition, such as body size, stored energy and osmoregulatory function, could drive individual variation in the selection of estuary habitat. Here we investigated the role of variation in physiological condition on the selection of estuarine and ocean habitat by sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts intercepted at the initiation of their 650-km downstream migration from Chilko Lake, Fraser River, British Columbia (BC). Behavioural salinity preference experiments were conducted on unfed smolts held in fresh water at three time intervals during their downstream migration period, representing the stage of migration at lake-exit, and the expected timing for estuary-entry and ocean-entry (0, 1 and 3 weeks after lake-exit, respectively). In general, salinity preference behaviour varied across the three time periods consistent with expected transition from river to estuary to ocean. Further, individual physiological condition did influence habitat choice. Smolt condition factor (K) and energy density were positively correlated with salinity preference behaviour in the estuary and ocean outmigration stages, but not at lake-exit. Our results suggest that smolt physiological condition upon reaching the estuary could influence migratory behaviour and habitat selection. This provides evidence on the temporally dependent interplay of physiology, behaviour and migration in wild juvenile Pacific salmon, with juvenile rearing conditions influencing smolt energetic status, which in turn influences habitat choice during downstream migration. The implication for the conservation of migratory species is that the relative importance of stopover habitats may vary as a function of initial condition.",

Yet, most studies of human-wildlife conflict and coexistence focus on a limited number of wildlife species. Methods: This study characterizes patterns of reported human-wildlife conflict in the Okavango region of Botswana based on records for all species from the Botswana Department of Wildlife and National Parks (2008 – 2016). Results: The reported incidents implicated a diverse range of wildlife species in conflict. The patterns indicated that for conflicts like crop and property damage, only a few main species were implicated, while livestock damage reports had more diversity of conflict species. Additionally, people in this region faced wildlife challenges throughout the year. Conclusion & Implications for Conservation: Having such variable types and timing of conflict, and from diverse species, may make it particularly difficult for people to mitigate costs and prevent further conflicts.",

          "description": "Nest survival drives population demographics of most avian species. Researchers and managers have focused studies on investigating nest success in association with climate, land use change (e.g., agriculture), and predators in the Prairie and Arctic biomes. The Boreal Forest is also an important breeding area for ducks and it has undergone rapid land use change caused by industrial development (e.g., oil and gas; forestry). However, duck nesting ecology has received little attention in this biome. Therefore, we investigated nest survival of upland nesting ducks in the Western Boreal Forest of Alberta, Canada, from 2016–2018. We evaluated how daily nest survival rates (N = 96) were affected by a suite of natural and anthropogenic variables measured at the nest-site (microhabitat) and landsc…",

Hierarchically stratified surveys (cluster sampling) offer an efficient approach to sampling in remote areas, but an appropriate balance is needed between cost efficiency and statistical independence. The cost-effectiveness of cluster sampling likely varies with temporal sampling intensity (e.g., single vs. multiple repeat samples) due to differences in spatial autocorrelation. Our aim was to assess the trade-offs between spatial and temporal replication and optimize sampling in which temporal replication occurs. We used bootstrap resampling to create alternative designs from multi-species avian point-count and autonomous …",
